# Description
Quantum Theater takes quantum science as subject and method for immersive theater. Phenomena like entanglement, superposition, coherence, and collapse shape the performance in a post-AI exploration of liveness, variability, and improv. Multiple realities are layered on stage, where the audience as observer-participant plays an active role in cohering singular narratives.
